## DOTS-CONNECT-DETA

A basic websocket backend to allow users to join arbitrary rooms, send messages in that room, get messages from that room.
It currently acts as a naive middle-man to broadcast messages between people in the same room.
Nothing is saves in the backend for now.

## Prerequisites

1. Need [python >= 3.7.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-376/)
2. (Optional) Recommeded to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) as a primary python distribution.
3. Need [Redis](https://redis.io/) for channel backend.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Install the requirements

```console
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start Redis Server in a new console window. Make sure that the redis-server uses localhost:6379

```console
redis-server
```

4. Run server

```console
python manage.py runserver
```

5. Run Celery and Celery Beat to run celery tasks [Optional]. These tasks will remove stale users from the channel.

```console
celery -A dots_connect_deta.tasks worker -l info --without-gossip --without-mingle --without-heartbeat
```

```console
celery -A dots_connect_deta.tasks beat -l info --scheduler django_celery_beat.schedulers:DatabaseScheduler
```

## Client Usage

1. Open Websocket connection

```js
const chatSocket = new WebSocket(
  "ws://" + window.location.host + "/ws/chat/" + roomName + "/"
);
```

2. Listen for websocket for any data

```js
chatSocket.onmessage = function (e) {
  const data = JSON.parse(e.data);
  console.log(data);
  // data will be a Object of the form {message: "...xyz..."}
};
```

3. Better to handle disconnect

```js
chatSocket.onclose = function (e) {
  console.error("Chat socket closed unexpectedly");
};
```

4. Send a message to the room

```js
chatSocket.send(
  JSON.stringify({
    message: "...your payload here...",
  })
);
```

5. Send a special `heartbeat` message at every 10 seconds to ensure that you don't get kicked out. By default the user will be kicked out if he/she is older than `CHANNELS_CONNECTION_MAX_AGE` value. You can set this value in [here](./config/settings/misc.py)

```js
setInterval(function () {
  chatSocket.send(JSON.stringify("heartbeat"));
}, 10000);
```
